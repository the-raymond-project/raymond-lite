This involves silently noting the experience of sadness when it arises. For example, you might note \"sadness, sadness\" in your mind as you become aware of the emotion. By doing this, you can develop a greater level of sensory clarity and mindfulness towards your emotions, while at the same time practicing equanimity in the face of difficult emotions. This technique can help you to learn to accept your emotions without becoming overwhelmed by them, allowing you to relate to yourself with greater compassion and understanding.",
